# 2D Ball Game

A Unity 2D game where a dynamic ball interacts with rotating rings. The gameplay features realistic physics, where the ball bounces off rings on collision. When the ball exits a ring, that ring collapses and the ball increases in size, making the game progressively more challenging.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Physics:** Utilizes Unity's Rigidbody2D to simulate realistic ball movement and bouncing.
- **Interactive Rings:** Rotating rings (both clockwise and counterclockwise) that collapse when the ball exits them.
- **Progressive Challenge:** As the ball grows in size after each ring collapse, the gameplay becomes more challenging and engaging.
